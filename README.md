Group member: Peter Bollhorn

This is my Mini Project 1.

Contents of the repo:
- **mini_project_1.ipynb**: Notebook which presents my solution to project.
- **read_from_formula1_website.ipynb**: Notebook which reads race results from formula1.com to html files.
- **f1_reader.py**: Module which reads Formula 1 data.
- **reader.py**: Module which reads generic CSV files and Excel files.
- **PointsScoringSystems.xlsx**: Excel file with the different points scoring systems used in Formula 1 throughout the years.
- **html_samples**: Folder with a sample of 3 html files.

Not all the HTML files are included in this repo, because there are 1128 of them, and in total they take up 600 MB.
